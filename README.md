# Introduction

## Hello the all of the GitHub

The contents of this **Readme.md** is to present all instructions of the use  correct of the **runtoolsvectors.py and runvectors2dim.py programs**. Before of use the programs the user will duty have installed *the python3 interpreter*. 
**[Warning-1]**. No use the version: 2 of the python interpreter.

Below do a **small description theoretical** of the **symbols** used in representation of the vectors. In the main point of the mathematics as *Calculus* and *Linear Algebra* as too in *Analytic Geometry* the Vectors have  symbols to will be representeds. 

Some authors of Calculus do the analytic definition of vectors using **coordinates (x,y) for any point P in plane** to associate a unique **ordered pair <x,y>** to the **vector v = vectorOP** ( whose initial point is the origin O ) and the **coordinates (x,y,z) for any point Q in space** to associate a unique **ordered triple<x,y,z>** to the **vector w = vectorOQ**.

It is important to note that **the vectors <x,y>  and <x,y,z>** are **ordered pairs and triples of reals numbers**, are not **points (x,y) and (x,y,z) in the plane and space**. For the **vectors v = <x,y> and vector w = <x,y,z>**, the **numbers x and y** are the **components of the vector v** and  the **numbers x, y and z** are the **components of the vector w**.

### In the Linear Algebra a list of values 
```
v = (v1,v2,v3) is called a linear array or vector
```
### Any triples of points: P(p1,p2,p3) and Q(q1,q2,q3) in |R¬≥ define the located vector from P to Q, written as vector PQ. 

### Vector PQ = Q ‚Äì P = [ q1 ‚Äì p1, q2 ‚Äì p2, q3 - p3]

Neither always the developers of programming language use the same symbols as is represented in  mathematics when create new programming languages. The *reader* more interested in subject will can acess the best books of **Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Analytic Geometry of the higher education**. 

In Python programming language , **an list data structure** are represented to **a pair square bracket [ ]**.and **an tuple data structure** are represented to **a pair square parentheses ( )**. Python program may use a *list or tuple data structure* to represent a vector. Was use the tuple data structure only to represent the coordinates of the vertexes points: P, Q, and R of triangles and too the coordinates of the vertexes points: P, Q, R and S of parallelogram, parallelepiped and tetrahedron into code of the functions into modules. 

### The main point of the mathematics developed into the functions of the VectorModDev.py and VectorModule2Dim.py modules was use *definitions* and *theorems* that are:

#### 1. Operations (Addition and Subtraction) on Vectors in Plane and in Space.
#### 2. Given two points: P and Q in Plane and Space get to theorem the vector that represent the displacement, distance, midpoint between two points.
#### 3. Find the length of any vector
#### 4. The scalar product of two vectors in Plane and in Space.
#### 5. Calculate the Cosine as too the angle between two vectors using the scalar product
#### 6. Find the following dimensions: sideA=|vectorA|, sideB=|vectorB|, sideC=|vectorC|, Perimeter(P), and Area(A) of a triangle PQR given the points: P, Q, and R in Plane.
#### 7. The Cross Product of two vectors in Space.
#### 8. Get the height(h) and area(S) of an parallelogram PQRS given the two vectors.
#### 9. Find the volume(V) and the height(h) of the parallelepiped determined by vectors: a, b, and c using the triple scalar product.
#### 10. Calculate the area(A) of the triangle PQR given the points: P, Q, and R in Space.
#### 11. Find sinŒ∏ where Œ∏ is the angle between the vectors b and c.
#### 12. Givens the coordinates of two points:  P and Q in Plane or Space, find the vector a=vectorPQ and too your length.
#### 13. Determine the [Direction Cosines] and [Direction Angles] givens the Vector a or two points: P and Q in Space. 

#### When developed the VectorModDev.py and VectorModule2Dim.py modules, almost all the functions developed was use the Vectorial Algebra in a list data structure to reduce the size of the functions. As the Python lists are well powerful the runvectors2dim.py and runtoolsvectors.py programs  will process any calculus using the inner functions of the previous modules. *The functions: vectornumber(), introduce(), instruction1(), instruction2() and ResultantVector()* are the only that *was not use* in the *list data structure*.
 
The **runtoolsvectors.py and runvectors2dim.py programs** was developed to the programmers as also to teachers and  students of the higher education to  find speed answer when will solve the vectors problems. In **codes** of the **VectorModDev.py and VectorModule2Dim.py modules**, was do represent the **vertexes points: P, Q, R and S** and the **vectors: A, B, and C** of the following manner:

### Point P, Q, R, and S in the Plane: 

### Point P: P(xP,yP)
### Point Q: Q(xQ,yQ)
### Point R: R(xR,yR)
### Point S: S(xS,yS)

### Point P, Q, R, and S in the Space: 

### Point P: P(xP,yP,zP)
### Point Q: Q(xQ,yQ,zQ)
### Point R: R(xR,yR,zR)
### Point S: S(xS,yS,zS)

### To any values attribute to the [Coordinates]: xP, yP, zP, xQ, yQ, zQ, xR, yR, zR, xS, yS, zS by users.

### The vectors: A, B, and C in the Plane:

### [vectorA]: vectorA[xA,yA]
### [vectorB]: vectorB[xB,yB]
### [vectorC]: vectorC[xC,yC]

### The vectors: A, B, and C in the Space:

### [vectorA]: vectorA[xA,yA,zA]
### [vectorB]: vectorB[xB,yB,zB]
### [vectorC]: vectorC[xC,yC,zC]

### To any values attribute to the [Components]: xA, yA, zA, xB, yB, zB, xC, yC, zC by users.


**[Warning-2]** ‚Äì Was standardize **the letters: A, B, and C to the vectors** and **P, Q, R, and S to points of the vertexes of triangles, parallelogram and parallelepiped into the code of the functions** of the  **VectorModDev.py and VectorModule2Dim.py modules**. 

All the development of the **functions** inside of the **VectorModDev.py and VectorModule2Dim.py modules** are isolate because of the use of **Vectors in the Plane and Space**. The *files:* **instruction1User.pdf and instruction2User.pdf** have all the **instructions** necessary of as use the **runvectors2dim.py and runtoolsvectors.py program** with *examples*. Are *examples selected and eases of use*. The **runtoolsvectors.py and runvectors2dim.py programs** too have **inner instructions** showed when are be used. *All the users* too will duty follow this instructions showed into as display. All *theory* with the **definitions and theorems of vectors** was be used in development of the **functions** inside of the **VectorModDev.py and VectorModule2Dim.py modules**.

#### The ResultantVector() function will find the Resultant(|R) Vector by means of the Decomposion Components. Any user that enter 2 or 3 or 4 or . . . or any number the vectors in polar form will get the Resultant(|R) Vector of propose problem. The ResultantVector() function was created to solve mechanics problems using vectors to the beginner students of the higher education  of  physics, mathematics, chemistry as too engineering. Was have origin when was buy and learned programm the powerful HP 32 SII RPN SCIENTIFIC Calculator. My repository have an *free copy* of the ATVUDE program to all know as too use. The ResultantVector() function is well more powerful than the ATVUDE program. The ResultantVector() function reside only in the VectorModule2Dim.py module. To use this function key [10] after run the runvectors2dim.py program.

**[Warning-3]** ‚Äì Use the **runvectors2dim.py program** with the **functions** developed into the  **VectorModule2Dim.py module** to **solve problems in Plane** of the same manner with the **runtoolsvectors.py program** using the **functions** developed into the **VectorModDev.py module** to **solve problems in Space**.

When the **runtoolsvectors.py and runvectors2dim.py programs** process the solutions requested, *all the results will showed by reals numbers*. **No result will presented in root or as fraction**. *All the roots or fractions are processed before of the end result*.  

The **runtoolsvectors.py and runvectors2dim.py programs** *will not present no geometric design* of the *Vectors operations*. The full theory about Vectors will can be finded in the best new and old books of calculus. With the **runtoolsvectors.py and runvectors2dim.py programs** will help all the *developers(or programmers), teachers, students higher graduation* as too *any person of any field* the find the speed solution.
