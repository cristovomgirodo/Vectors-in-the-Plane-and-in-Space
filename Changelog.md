The new **[version: 1.3]** of the files: **instructions1-v1.3_User.pdf**, **runvectors2dim.py**, and **VectorModule2Dim.py** been necessary to upgrade of the **ResultantVector() function** inside of the **VectorModule2Dim.py** module. The [introduce()] function been used to datas enter: angle and radius to any vector until the last [version: 1.2]; but this function let set values: [negative] or [zero] or [positive] using float numbers to angle as too radius. Get **the components: Vx *and* Vy** with values: **[negative] or [zero] to the [radius] of any [vector]** is a [error]** because of find the components: Vx and Vy with [errors]. To [solve] this *serious problem* developed the new **[radiusenter()] function** to **datas enter [positive] only to the [radius] of any [vector]**.

The [code] between the lines: 77 until 85 in the last [version: 1.2] of the **VectorModule2Dim.py** module been *[deleted]*. The new **[radiusenter()] function** will do all the work in the new [version: 1.3].

You will note the new **[radiusenter()] function** between the lines: 45 until 68 inside the **VectorModule2Dim.py** module.

The **ResultantVector() function** inside of the **VectorModule2Dim.py** module too been upgrade in the lines: 103, between 117 until 120, and 125.


The Readme.md file almost been presented all the new [version: 1.2] upgrade.


**[new warning]**:

When the users give two clicks in the **runvectors2dim.py or runtoolsvectors.py programs** inside of **Windows operating system** will be executed in an screen small size in the Launches Python 3.8 (64-bit) interpreter different of the presented in any Terminal of the Linux operating system. To adjust the size follow the instructions below:

1. Click in start button and access the Python directory presented in the menu. After click in the Launches Python 3.8 (64-bit) interpreter. When the screen open click with the right button in the title slash and wait the menu open. Follow keyed in the [property] menu guide to open an new form.

2. After give an click in the [Layout] guide and do adjust the screen size: Width: 100 and Height: 60.

3. In following key in the [font] guide and adjust the size: 12 x 16.

4. By last click in the [color] guide and adjust the [screen text]: yellow and [Plane of screen background]: blue and key OK guide to end.

Note: The user is free to do other adjust. When the runvectors2dim.py or runtoolsvectors.py programs was execute again will have an [new screen] to run. If any user execute the  runvectors2dim.py or runtoolsvectors.py programs using the [option]: [Run] ==> [Run module] in the IDLE Python Shell already was be OK before of the [version: 1.1].

Because of [new warning] was necessary adjust the runvectors2dim.py or runtoolsvectors.py programs as too the VectorModule2Dim.py and VectorModDe.py modules to the [new version: 1.1].

All the development of the **runvectors2dim.py** or **runtoolsvectors.py** programs and too the **VectorModule2Dim.py** and **VectorModDev.py** modules was using the Python programming language inside of **Linux operating system**.
